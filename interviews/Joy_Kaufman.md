### First off, what do you do, where do you work, and how long have you been in the industry?
 I work at RTI International as a Programmer, and I've been on the operations side of tech for 4 years. This year was my first time in a full on tech gig though, so I am a newbie. 

### What’s something technical you do to become a better developer[/designer/PM]?
There are a million and one things I can do better as a programmer. The obvious refactoring, but my company also inherits contracts from a lot of other government contractors, so sometimes we need to give a total makeover to train wreck code! Although my work is sort of old fashioned in its tech stack, I like keeping up with emerging and popular frameworks particularly in JS, which was a tough language for me at first, syntax goon here, haha. I also came up learning MVC applications, and
 getting used to MV* and MVVM was quite weird at first, I am constantly studying up on these alien ideas! 

 So aside from Stack Overflow and the other obvious players, there isn't a one size fits all go-to site to learn new things. I do app building tutorials, read books, use command line gems like Bacon.js, and when I'm tired even tune into codeacademy and codeschool on occasion, although I feel like they are considered bush league. (But hey - they are like a more palatable version of eating your veggies to really pound programming into your brain.) I think that when you get to a certain
 point you get an intuition about sites, that you can tell when an obscure page is the key you are looking for. 

### What’s a soft skill you think is important to become better?
 -Subskills: as a new programmer, it is hard to know when to ask for help. You want to be respectful of other programmers time. You worry about seeming dumb. Rule of thumb: weigh business operations against problem solving capacity - roughly, if you are stuck on a bug more than 1-2 hours, ask for a pointer. 

### Do you do something outside of work that you think makes you better?
I do lots outside of work that helps me think better, mainly code. Also, reading technical publications. Going to workshops. Pushing my boundaries. 

### What’s something you wish you could tell your younger self?
I wish I could tell my younger self that I shouldn't have shied away from tech out of fear for so long. For a long time, I thought as a technical recruiter I had little right to my tech dreams, when I did. And I'm doing well in my breakout tech role although I did really have to work for it, as a career-changer. 

### If you could learn one new technology, what would it be?  
If I could learn one new technology? That question doesn't make sense in my line of work. There are new libraries and frameworks every day. There are something like thousands of programming languages in existence, and I'm sure I wouldn't grow bored learning them all. That's how deep this field is, and why it is like catnip to people who don't like being bored. I don't really care what I'm learning, as long as it is useful. Between building applications and application security, I'm sure I could happily learn throughout my career without running out of new subject matter.
