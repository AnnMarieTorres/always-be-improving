# Veni Kunche

### First off, what do you do, where do you work, and how long have you been in the industry?
I have been in the tech industry for over 10 years. I currently work part-time as a Senior Developer at the [Web Informatics and Mapping group](http://wim.usgs.gov/#/) at the US Geological Survey (USGS). I recently added internationalization to [Every Kid in a Park](https://everykidinapark.gov/), a Django web application. Now users can view the site in Spanish. Another project is for the [USGS Mercury Research Lab](http://wi.water.usgs.gov/mercury-lab/research/index.html). I migrated all of their data from an Oracle database to a PostgreSQL database to cut costs. I also built a service to help them load their water sample data in bulk.

Along with working with at the USGS, I am also the founder of Code with Veni, a newsletter to guide newbie women developers and United Women of Tech, a directory of women in tech communities around the world.

### What’s something technical you do to become a better developer[/designer/PM]?
As a developer, you have to constantly keep up with new languages and frameworks. For me, reading books or following online tutorials doesn’t quite work. I have to work on something concrete. In order to keep up, I either incorporate learning new things at work or I work on side projects. 

### What’s a soft skill you think is important to become better?
Communication. It’s a necessary soft skill. You need to be able to talk to your clients without tech jargon. It is also important to have written communication skills. I work remotely and most of my communication is either done though emails or slack. I think it’s best to over communicate rather than leave things to misunderstandings. 

### Do you do something outside of work that you think makes you better?
As I mentioned previously, I work on a lot of side projects. That really helps in setting myself apart. If I don’t have the time, I at least try to be aware of new things that are happening in web development. Cooper Press has a lot of newsletters that are great. If I see a recurring theme, I try to dig into that topic more.

### What’s something you wish you could tell your younger self?
I would tell my younger self to network more. For a really long time, I went through my career alone. It makes a huge different to be part of a community and a bigger network. More opportunities open up to you.

### If you could learn one new technology, what would it be?
 When I have the time, I’d love get to know the hardware side of things. I would love to work on a project from [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/) to get started.
