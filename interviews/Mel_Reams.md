### First off, what do you do, where do you work, and how long have you been in the industry?
I'm a fullstack developer (primarily backend, but I'll do frontend when it needs doing) at a startup called Referral SaaSquatch. I've been there for about a year and a half and I've been working as a developer for ten years now.

### What’s something technical you do to become a better developer[/designer/PM]?
I sort of do my own little post-mortems when I finish tasks - I think about what went well, what didn't, and how I can do better next time. Everyone makes mistakes but I try to make different ones.
### Sub-topic: what are resources you find helpful to keep your skills sharp?
Blogs! Blogs are great, I learn all sorts of stuff that isn't always immediately useful but is often very useful later. Talks on YouTube are also great, there's an incredible amount of content out there and all you have to pay is your time.
          
### What’s a soft skill you think is important to become better?
Communication! I've never worked for a company that only had one developer, so I've always had to communicate with the rest of my team, but even a team of one would have to talk with the rest of the company to make sure they understand what the company actually needs them to build, which is not always what they asked for.

### Do you do something outside of work that you think makes you better?
I watch talks on youtube, go to lots of meetups/talks, volunteer a lot (shoutout to Ladies Learning Code), and blog. I've gotten some really nice comments from friends about how much they like my blog, but I think it does me more good than it does them because I understand concepts like interface segregation a lot better after I write about them. If nobody read it I would keep blogging because it's so useful to me. Like blogging, volunteering is really useful both because it forces me to explain things and because beginners ask such interesting questions about stuff I take for granted.
                
###  What’s something you wish you could tell your younger self?
Younger Mel, you are never going to feel like you've mastered programming. It's okay, nobody else ever feels like they've mastered programming either. I've spent a lot of time thinking that if I could just get a handle on object oriented design, or servlets, or spring, or struts, or design patterns, or (the list never actually ends), then I would feel like I had mastered programming and stop having days where nothing worked and I just felt useless. With programming, mastering one thing just means you start seeing a new class of problems at a higher level, there's no finish line where you can declare yourself done learning.

### If you could learn one new technology, what would it be?
I would love to learn functional programming. I've heard great things about functional languages like OCaml and how a whole class of bugs just goes away when you use a functional language with a good solid type system.
