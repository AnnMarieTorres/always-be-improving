### First off, what do you do, where do you work, and how long have you been in the industry?
I'm actually still currently a student (senior in college, last semester!) but I've got a job lined up for Google at YouTube come September 2017.  I've also interned there twice the past two summers.

### What’s something technical you do to become a better developer[/designer/PM]?
 I always try to do new things.  I explore any outlet I can and ask as many questions as possible.  I don't have a specific website I go to to work on my skills, it's mainly personal projects that help me advance and improve.  Also, while I regrettably haven't gone to any yet this year, hackathons are great.  They're such a fabulous resource for quick, hands-on learning.  I co-founded HackHolyoke at Mount Holyoke College...so I could be slightly biased...but I've learned so much from going
  to hacks.  Better yet, I've learned what I don't like to work on and learning what you don't like to do is almost more important than learning what you do like to do.  

###  What’s a soft skill you think is important to become better?
Since I founded HackHolyoke,  I think leadership skills are very  important to becoming a better developer.  I focus on how to get a job done and how to communicate effectively.  If you can work well with a team, you'll succeed anywhere you go.  

### Do you do something outside of work that you think makes you better?
I'm a musician.  I'm actually a double computer science and music major and for my senior thesis I'm releasing an EP this April.  I'm traveling down to Nashville in March to record it and then hopefully going to go on a cross-country coffee shop tour this summer while moving out to San Francisco for work.  Music is my outlet and I think it's great to have something completely different to work on in addition to your profession.  If you'd like more information about my music you can follow me
on [twitter](https://twitter.com/evasnyder), [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/eva-snyder) or [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/heyyitseva)! 

### What’s something you wish you could tell your younger self?
Don't stress so much over the small things. I didn't have too many friends in high school and mainly stuck to myself throughout the 4 years - but because of that I was able to discover who I am and focus on something I love (music) which I think has been a main influence on where I stand today.  I used to get so worried over such small little things but now I can see the bigger picture and know that it's not worth it.   

### If you could learn one new technology, what would it be?  
Oh goodness - such a loaded question.  On a serious note: I would like to learn more about VR.  I've done a little with it...but not enough.  On a fun note: I really seriously want to learn how to play the Theremin.
