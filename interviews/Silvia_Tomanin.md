### First off, what do you do, where do you work, and how long have you been in the industry?
I am a technical product manager coming from a web engineering background. I have been working on web apps and infrastructure products for about 8 years. I have been working with several small and big international organisations such as CERN and Doctors Without Borders. At the moment I am consulting for a small non profit in the GMT+1 timezone.

### What’s something technical you do to become a better developer[/designer/PM]?
I try to always be surrounded by people that know more than I do. I read a lot about other PMs experiences. I go to industry meetups and keep myself up to date taking online courses. 

### What’s a soft skill you think is important to become better?
Curiosity, resilience and being able to listen.
   
### Do you do something outside of work that you think makes you better?
I like to take part in hackatons. I particularly loved one: [ThePort hackathon at CERN](http://theport.ch/), where interdisciplinary teams use tech to solve humanitarian challenges.

### What’s something you wish you could tell your younger self?
  First of all RTFM! Then get a mentor and don't be afraid to ask. You are going to save a lot of time on StackOverflow.
Also that having a big impact on a product / in a company / organization is not the norm, is the exception. Be proud if it happens.

### If you could learn one new technology, what would it be?  
All of them! It's hard to choose really. I have recently finished a specialization in interaction design, maybe now I will focus on machine learning... or a new programming language... or blockchain or... 

 Having to choose, I would pick a side project and learn the technologies I need to bring it further.
