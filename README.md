# [Always Be Imroving: Curating Developer Experiences](https://github.com/sravanti/always-be-improving/tree/master/interviews)

Inspired by a Github project I saw [which curated interviews on how to be a better developer](https://github.com/ggomaeng/better-developer-quotes), I decided to run a similar project with my network, which focused on female developers. I asked anyone who was interested to fill out a short questionnaire focusing on how they improved their developer chops. There are some excellent tidbits of advice that I learned from doing these interviews, and I hope you find them to be helpful, too!

## Add your own experience
Ideally, this is just the beginning - I'd love for more people to participate. The more data points the better!

If you'd prefer to email me instead of opening a PR for any of the below, that's totally fine! I'm happy to update this repo if you send suggestions to sravanti150@gmail.com

### Interviews
Just open a PR with answers to the questions in the [interview template](https://github.com/sravanti/always-be-improving/blob/master/interviews/interview_template.md) (and add more if you'd like). The only editing I've been doing is for grammar and clarity.

### Mentors
There's also [another file here](https://github.com/sravanti/always-be-improving/blob/master/mentors.md) which is a list of people who are willing to be mentors for newbies in tech. Please feel free to open a PR if you'd like to add your name to the list of mentors.

### Resources
Similar to the list of mentors, there's a [list of resources](https://github.com/sravanti/always-be-improving/blob/master/resources.md) for developers which is broken down into categories. Feel free to open PRs for resources that you think could be helpful. 


**Happy learning and growing ðŸš€**
